**Overview**

- Used CNN model and trained with thousands of objects in 6000 pictures using CUDA. The accelerated module reduced the total required time by 80%.
- Counted	millions of objects in thousands of pictures within few hours by the built model and achieved 93% prediction accuracy for object	recognition.
