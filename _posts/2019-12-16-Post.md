**OS:** Ubuntu 16.04
**Background:** SQLite3 was installed before and now the user would like to install MySQL-workbench to monitor a database deployed on AWS.

**Problem:** After the installation of MySQL-workbench, it shows "/usr/lib/mysql-workbench/mysql-workbench-bin: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdal.so.1: undefined symbol: sqlite3_column_table_name" when the user trys to run MySQL-workbench.

This might caused by the SQLite3. Removing SQLite3 haven't solve this problem and you need to remove some other files.

**Solution:**
```.bash
$ cd '/usr/local/bin' && rm -f sqlite3
$ cd '/usr/local/include' && rm -f sqlite3.h sqlite3ext.h
$ rm -f '/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.la'
$ cd '/usr/local/share/man/man1' && rm -f sqlite3.1
$ cd '/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig' && rm -f sqlite3.pc
```
